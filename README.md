## Project Setup
This project assumes you have [Node.js v8](http://nodejs.org/) or greater installed which comes
the latest [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) v5 or greater installed as well. 

> Note: Sean uses [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/) instead of npm at times in this course. yarn and npm do the same thing, with a slightly different API.
> `npm run dev` vs `yarn dev`
> `npm install webpack-dev-server --save-dev` vs `yarn add webpack-dev-server`

## Getting Started
These steps will assume that you have `cd`'d in your preferred editor to this repositories cloned location.

1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Enjoy the course!

Tip: Use `git checkout BRANCH_NAME -f` to jump into a given branch. The `-f` will force overwriting your local changes.
